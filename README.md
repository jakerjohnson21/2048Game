# Jake's 2048

This is my remake of the 2048 game. Here's the original game: https://play2048.co

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repo and open the HTML file, or see it in action here: https://jakerjohnson21.github.io/2048Game/

## Instructions

Begin game with the 'New Game' button.

Then use keys to shift numbers:
  * 'W' : up
  * 'S' : down
  * 'A' : left
  * 'D' : right

Combine tiles with equal value and try to reach 2048!
